You are requested to assist the colony at **NEW SOUTHAMPTON** by the Union Naval Department Auxiliary Program.

The colony is establishing a space elevator, and relocating asteroid **NI-341B** to serve as an anchor. Radical elements from local religious groups, identified as radical anti-paracausal **LUDDIC PATH**, have seized the asteroid engine complex and are redirecting it towards the elevator base.
