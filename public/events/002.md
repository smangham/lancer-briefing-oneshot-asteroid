# INCOMING/OMNINET: NDAP PRIORITY A.a1 // 14.8.5014u
You are requested to assist the colony at **NEW SOUTHAMPTON** by the Union Naval Department Auxiliary Program.

The colony is cleaning a major toxic spill from previous colonisation efforts using a whitewash nanite hive. The hive malfunctioned at 07:00; Union response teams discovered HORUS operatives have injected it with unknown paracode.

The hive is generating increasingly exotic greywash matching no known patterns. There is a high risk of iteration towards blackwash. Extract the response team and destroy transport links behind you; we cannot risk the hive escaping the area before **UNS Kinabalu** can get into position to neutralise with saturation lance bombardment.
