# INCOMING/OMNINET: NDAP PRIORITY A.a1 // 21.2.5014u
You are requested to assist the colony at **NEW SOUTHAMPTON** by the Union Naval Department Auxiliary Program.

The colony is cleaning a major toxic spill from earlier colonisation efforts using a whitewash nanoswarm generated by a set of deployed hives.
HORUS terrorists have inject the hives with unknown paracode, and they are generating increasingly exotic greywash. Extract the local Union crews and destroy transport links behind you; we cannot risk the hives iterating towards blackwash.
